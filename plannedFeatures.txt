Planned Features (target: Version 2.0)

1. Real-Time Analytics Dashboard
   - Objective: provide operators with live metrics about kiosk usage, source performance, and system health.
   - Notes: integrate a lightweight telemetry collector and surface charts within the admin settings area.

2. Multi-Device Sync
   - Objective: allow multiple kiosks to share schedules and configuration changes through a central service.
   - Notes: introduce optional cloud synchronization with conflict resolution and admin notifications.

3. Offline Fallback Enhancements
   - Objective: ensure kiosks remain functional without network connectivity by caching assets and schedules.
   - Notes: add asset prefetching, graceful degradation messaging, and automatic resync once connectivity returns.
