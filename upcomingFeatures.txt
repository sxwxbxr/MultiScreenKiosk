Upcoming Features (target: Version 1.0)

1. Multi-Language Interface
   - Objective: offer localization and runtime language switching for all UI elements.
   - Implementation: externalize strings into translation files (e.g., Qt .qm) and add a language selector in settings; default to system locale.
   - Acceptance Criteria: all visible strings change when language is switched, including dialogs and menus.

2. Content Scheduling
   - Objective: rotate displayed sources (URLs or apps) based on defined time blocks.
   - Implementation: allow schedule definitions per pane specifying source and time ranges; scheduler swaps sources accordingly.
   - Acceptance Criteria: content changes at scheduled times with minimal disruption and schedule is editable via settings.
